# Natural Disaster Prediction Model

The Natural Disaster Prediction Model leverages deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict and identify natural disasters (Worked specificly for wildfire as of now). Additional data sources such as satellite imagery, weather data are integrated to capture a comprehensive view of the disasters. Our project offers disaster preparedness, and efficient response, addressing critical societal challenges.

## Problem Statement

The problem statement involves developing AI algorithms and models that utilize environmental data to predict and identify potential natural disasters, providing early warnings and assisting in disaster preparedness and response efforts.

## Key Features and Functionality

• Technologies Used: Deep learning (CNNs), TensorFlow, Keras, Python.

• New Components: CNN model architecture and data preprocessing.

• Scaling Parameters: Data sizes (number of images) and QPS estimates (prediction speed).

• Rollout Strategy: Data collection, model development, training, evaluation, and deployment/integration.

• Information Security/Privacy Concerns: Protecting data through measures like anonymization, encryption, access controls, and secure transmission.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, we plan to incorporate the following enhancements with different image datasets of hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes to predict and identify various potential natural disasters.

• Integration with real-time satellite data to provide live updates and adjust predictions accordingly.
• Create a user interface with interactive visualizations.
